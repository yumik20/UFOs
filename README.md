# UFOs

## Overview 
This project is to use UFO data to create a webpage to allow user to interact with the data by filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria, such as city, state, date. Etc. 


### purpose 
Create a webpage so people can enter certain keywords to filter out the data sets. 


## Results 
Most of the UFOs are found in the smaller cities or rural areas. In this data set, most of them are found in CA. 
Triangle, light and sphere are quite common in terms of shape, they are more common than circle. Although people found the UFOs in different shapes and describe differently most of the time, but there are some descriptions in common, such as 3 red lights, etc. 


## Summary: 


### drawback of this webpage 
The data that are available for this website is only from 1/1/2010 -1/13/2010 within the US. There aren't enough data from other years and other locations. 



### further development 
It could good to include more data from other years, countries. Also it would be great to have dropdown instead of keywords for user to choose from.
